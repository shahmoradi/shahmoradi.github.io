            Prior to joining <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/">ICES</a>, I was very fortunate to work in multiple world-renown research institutes including the national <a target="_blank" href="http://w3fusion.ph.utexas.edu/ifs/">Institute for Fusion Studies</a> (IFS), the <a target="_blank" href="https://icmb.utexas.edu/">Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology</a> (iCMB), as well as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cpge.utexas.edu/">Center for Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering</a> (CPGE) and the <a target="_blank" href="http://ccbb.biosci.utexas.edu/">Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics</a> (CCBB), at The University of Texas at Austin, either during my PhD studies as a graduate research assistant or later on, as research scientist. Prior to getting my PhD at UT Austin, I gained several years of research experience in theoretical and observational High Energy Astrophysics and Cosmology, under the directions of <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn.html" target="_blank">Dr. Robert Nemiroff </a> -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" target="_blank">NASA</a> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html" target="_blank">GSFC</a> scientist and professor at <a href="http://www.mtu.edu/physics/" target="_blank">Michigan Tech University</a> -- where my research focus was primarily on the theoretical and computational aspects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst" target="_blank">Gamma Ray Bursts</a> and their possible applications as Cosmological tools. More information on my research interests is available <a href="http://www.shahmoradi.org/research/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
            <br>
            
            I received my Bachelor’s degree in Physics from <a href="http://www.sharif.ir/en/" target="_blank">Sharif University of Technology</a> -- in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia" target="_blank">Persia</a> -- which is considered as the best and the most competitive technological university of Iran and according to some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s957W6jomBc" target="_blank"></a>, one of the finest universities in the world preparing undergraduates. My B.Sc. thesis was in the area of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_astrophysics" target="_blank">Particle Astrophysics</a>. To be specific, I investigated the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%E2%80%93Pomeranchuk%E2%80%93Migdal_effect" target="_blank">Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal</a> (LPM) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_field" target="_blank">GeoMagnetic Field</a> (GMF) effects on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon" target="_blank">Muon</a> Content of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_shower_%28physics%29" target="_blank">Extensive Air Showers</a> produced by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-energy_cosmic_ray" target="_blank">Extremely High Energy</a> (EHE) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray" target="_blank">Cosmic Rays</a>. </p>

            <p><span class="firstcharacter">Religion</span> Growing up in a religious but modern society in the city of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran">Tehran</a>, the capital of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia" target="_blank">Persia</a>, I was drown from an early age to the mystique world of ancient religions and philosophical writings. My passion for philosophical and religious knowledge grew continuously throughout high school and college to the present day. I still read religious and philosophical scripture regularly, although less frequently than I used to in college years, mainly due to time constraints. A rather-complete list of books, including religious and philosophical, that I have already read or I am currently reading can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5841673-amir-shahmoradi">my Goodreads profile</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?uid=107700563304851562289">my Google library</a>.<br><br>
            Although I may not be considered religious according to the most common definitions of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, I know half of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran">Quran</a> by heart, and I have read the entire <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament">Old Testament</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament">New Testament</a> on multiple occasions.
            </p><br>
            
            <p><span class="firstcharacter">Science</span>Living in an academic household specially due to my father's passion for science, I have developed a sense of scientific scepticism that has often led me to question the basic tenets of any non-scientific knowledge. My interest in science in particular physics, astronomy and biology began with the first two books that my father bought me when I did not even know how to read alphabets: one on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXPZzijKszI">human body factory</a> and the other a book by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0ch2kzFsOMQC&dq=Our+Milky+Way+and+Other+Galaxies+asimov&source=gbs_navlinks_s"><i>The Milky Way and Other Galaxies</i></a>. These books together with other science and science-fiction books by Asimov, and later in high school, the books on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity">the theory of Relativity</a>, in particular one by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> titled <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ehPOqbEnNZsC&dq=relativity+special+and+general+einstein&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBGoVChMI4P_RvvT7xwIVQlCSCh0iRQ9f"><i>Relativity</i></a> profoundly shaped my world-line and who I am today. Despite my parents' great desire, I derailed the train who my older brother and sister had already taken to Medical School and applied only to the 6 best Physics program in the country and was accepted to my first and favorite choice at <a href="http://www.sharif.ir/en/" target="_blank">Sharif University of Technology</a>.<br><br>
            
            I was introduced to the world of information and computer programming by my father and older brother, when I was about 8 years old. By the end of elementary school, I was so impressed with and knew enough about computer software to write a few simple <a target="_blank" href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game">computer games</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic programming language</a>, on our first family personal computer, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_386SLC">IBM 386</a>. I never imagined a day I would use computer programming for scientific purposes; Nevertheless, there has not been almost a single day that I have not used scientific programming for my work and research, ever since I entered graduate school.</p><br>
            
            <p><span class="firstcharacter">Poetry</span>Other than scientific literature and interests, I have great passion for traditional <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_literature">Persian Poetry</a>.  Specifically, I am fond of the masterpieces by the great Persian poets, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi">Molana</a> (Rumi), <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m">Khayyam</a> , and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_Shirazi">Saadi</a>. I have read more than twice the entire <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulistan_%28book%29">Golestan</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bustan_%28book%29">Boostan</a> by Saadi, in addition to the first and second books of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masnavi">Masnavi</a> and much of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwan-e_Shams-e_Tabrizi">Divan Shams</a> by Molana, and regularly read <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubaiyat_of_Omar_Khayyam">Rubaiyat</a> by Khayyam. Despite seemingly belonging to entirely different schools of thoughts, both <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi"></a>Rumi (the symbol of love and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism">Sufism</a>) and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayy%C3%A1m">Khayyam</a> (the symbol of wisdom and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism">agnosticism</a>) have been highly influential charismatic figures in my personal life and both true serve as my <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_model">role models</a>.<br><br>
            
            I was also introduced to the world of Persian Calligraphy at a very young age by my father and I received the first rank honor in the statewide competition of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_calligraphy">Persian calligraphy</a> in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran">Tehran</a> while in elementary school. Although my parents then prevented me from attending the national contest, <a target="_blank" href="www.shahmoradi.org/img/farhad_challenge.jpg">Persian calligraphy</a> has ever since remained of my passions and leisure hobbies.</p><br>
            
            <p><span class="firstcharacter">Music</span>Despite still far from being a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucBfXpCA6s&index=34&list=PLBOZBzjO7ta9lEO9-7mOwYGEeoBJ4KGi4">professional pianist</a>, I have received discreet private trainings on playing piano from elementary to graduate school, with a touch on <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_composition">musical composition</a> by my great pianist, violinist, composer, and poet <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chouk.ir/honarmandan/8943-2014-06-27-11-06-24.html">Mr. Parviz Khamsehpour</a> at Sharif University of Technology. Among my favorite and inspirational musicians, pianists and composers are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vangelis">Vangelis</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin">Chopin</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Debussy">Debussy</a>.</p><br>
            
            <p><span class="firstcharacter">Hobbies</span>Ever since I witnessed the comet <a target="_blank" href="http://www.space.com/19931-hale-bopp.html">Hale-Bopp</a> passing by the earth during my childhood, I wanted to be an astronomer and have been fond of <a target="_blank" href="https://stardate.org/nightsky">stargazing</a>, still a regular hobby for me on clear-sky nights. I also used to have a great passion for <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_collecting">stamp collecting</a> as a kid and I have since garnered a large collection of old <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Persian+stamps&num=100&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CB0QsARqFQoTCKiNn96W_McCFUcRkgodYosG9g&biw=1536&bih=712">Persian stamps</a>. Soccer, badminton, swimming, skiing, and chess used to be my favorite sports, although it has been at least 4 years since the last time I played any of them except swimming, mainly due to time constraints and lack of motivated companies.</p><br>

<p>I recently wrote a guest blog post for the <a href="http://beacon-center.org/" target="_blank">Bio-computational Evolution in Action Consortium (BEACON)</a> on the importance of teaching, or at least introducing all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields" target="_blank">STEM</a> graduate students with cognitive sciences and cognitive flaws that can affect human mind and reasoning. The full post can found <a href="http://beacon-center.org/blog/2014/12/01/beacon-researchers-at-work-what-every-scientist-needs-to-know/" target="_blank">here</a>. The following is a summary of the post:</p>

<p><i> In a world in which science and technological breakthroughs dominate all aspects of almost every individual human life, scientists and researchers are under an ever increasing pressure to cross and expand the borders of human knowledge. As new discoveries require higher levels of precision and reproducibility, excess workload and hyper-competitive work environments have made researchers more prone to human cognitive biases. A solution to this emerging problem is to introduce all graduate students in STEM fields with the limitations of human mind and scientific instruments and their potential role in false positive discoveries and misconduct of scientific research. I suggest that a full-semester course that covers relevant topics including those mandated by NSF as Responsible Conduct of Research should be developed and tailored for each individual STEM field of research and be offered as an integral core course of every graduate program across the world.</i>

            <p>Today, the Wilke lab has published two studies on the selective pressures that protein structure exerts on evolving genetic sequences.  <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/12/179/abstract">The first,</a> published in BMC Evol. Biol., looks at broad evolutionary trends in yeast. This study shows that evolutionary rate varies linearly with relative solvent accessibility of residues (RSA, a measure for how close to the surface or the core of the protein a residue is located). Hence, more exposed residues evolve faster than more buried residues. <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/09/12/molbev.mss217">The second study,</a> published in Mol. Biol. Evol., uses the insight gained from the first to identify individual sites in viral protein that evolve more rapidly or more slowly than expected given their RSA. When applied to two proteins of the influenza virus, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, this method identified sites involved in cell entry, antibody binding, and drug resistance.</p>
