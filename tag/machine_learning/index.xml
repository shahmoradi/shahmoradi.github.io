        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is our great pleasure to announce that a former senior undergraduate member of our lab, &lt;a href=&quot;/people/#travis-p.-driver&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Travis Driver&lt;/a&gt;, has accepted an offer of admission from the Department of Aerospace at Georgia Institute of Technology. Travis will officially start his Ph.D. studies in fall 2019 at Georgia Tech. Travis joined the research efforts of our lab in 2017, upon taking a course in Python programming and computational engineering. He was able to quickly learn multiple different languages in addition to Python, including Fortran/C/C++, and contributed to our research in the field of machine learning algorithm development. The same year, Travis received several prestigious internships from NASA. Upon concluding his internships, Travis decided to pursue graduate studies in the field of Aerospace Engineering and received admissions to multiple schools, including Stanford, Georgia Tech, UT Austin, TAMU, and CU Boulder. Upon evaluating his choices and plans, Travis decided to begin his Ph.D. studies as part of Georgia Tech. Congratulations Travis!&lt;/p&gt;
