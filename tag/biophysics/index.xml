        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is our great pleasure to announce that a former senior undergraduate member of our lab, &lt;a href=&quot;/people/#bernadette-duhan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bernadette Duhan&lt;/a&gt;, has accepted an offer of admission from the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Bernadette will officially start her Ph.D. studies in the field of biophysics at UIUC in fall 2019. Bernie joined our lab in 2018, with research interest in bioinformatics, in particular, proteomics and the relationship between protein evolution and dynamics. Congratulations Bernadette!&lt;/p&gt;
