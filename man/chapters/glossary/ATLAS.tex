    \gitem{ATLAS}
        Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke (ATLAS) Release 1.1, is an open-source dataset consisting of 304 T1-weighted MRIs with manually segmented diverse lesions and metadata. The goal of ATLAS is to provide the research community with a standardized training and testing dataset for lesion segmentation algorithms on T1-weighted MRIs. This dataset is not representative of the full range of stroke, as this data was acquired through research studies in which individuals with stroke voluntarily participated, and all participants had to be eligible for a research MRI session. However, this dataset may be useful for testing and comparing the performance of different lesion segmentation techniques and identifying key barriers hindering the performance of automated lesion segmentation algorithms. We believe that this diverse set of manually segmented lesions will serve as a valuable resource for researchers to use in assessing and improving the accuracy of lesion segmentation tools.
